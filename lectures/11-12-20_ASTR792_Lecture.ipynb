    "# Radiative Trapping\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, in an effort to fully describe the excitation of molecular gas, we have considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the internal structure of the molecule (Einstein A values and other probabilities for transitions between energy levels set by quantum considerations related to the molecular geometry)\n",
    "* the transfer of energy due to the rate of physical collisions with other particles (including cosmic rays)\n",
    "* the transfer of energy from a background continuum radiation field\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one other key consideration needed to make a complete characterization of molecular excitation. This is the transfer of energy from molecule A (as it emits a photon to go from a state with $E_u$ to $E_l$) to molecule B, which may be able to use that photon itself to go from $E_l$ to $E_u$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is known as radiative trapping, and it becomes important when the gas becomes optically thick to line emission (e.g., there is a very short mean free path for a photon of a given energy to be absorbed by a molecule in a low-energy state that can absorb that photon and become excited). \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this together with all of the previous considerations we have discussed we finally arrive at the real deal: this is the basic physics that underlies observational ISM research which takes observed line intensities and uses them to determine the physical properties of the gas: its density, temperature, and column density. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also not a simple problem, as it is non-local: one cannot consider a single molecule at a time, but has to consider the impact of molecules in one part of a cloud on the excitation of molecules in another part of the cloud. As we will see, it thus depends on the geometry of the gas cloud as well as its velocity structure, as a sufficient Doppler shifting of the emitted photons will change their frequency enough to avoid reabsorption.

    "## Escape Probability Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "As is often the case, we will start by backing away from the full complexity of this problem, and making an approximation that greatly simplifies the math. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we begin by assuming that in many cases the problem is *not* as non-local as it seems, and we can begin to effectively decouple the excitation of a single molecule from the impact of molecules elsewhere in the cloud. We do this by determining, based on the geometry and velocity structure of the cloud, the likelihood $\\beta_nu$ that a photon emitted at a frequency $\\nu$ and a given location $r$ will be able to escape the cloud. This will be a function of its optical depth $\\tau_\\nu$ along all the possible paths with directions $\\hat{n}$ that it could take:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_\\nu (r) = \\displaystyle \\int \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi} e^{-\\tau_\\nu(r,\\hat{n})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically averaged over the normalized line profile $\\phi_\\nu$ (note that many basic radiative transfer codes just adopt a simplified rectangular line profile, while more sophisticated codes include more complicated line shapes):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\langle \\beta_\\nu(r)\\rangle = \\displaystyle \\int \\phi_\\nu \\beta_\\nu(r) d\\nu$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then construct a binary scenario which assumes that, based on this escape probability, either a photon is effectively absorbed by a molecule so close by that it can be assumed to be absorbed exactly where it was emitted (this is called the 'on the spot' approximation), or it leaves the cloud entirely. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further eliminate the importance of the location within the cloud on a molecule's excitation, we will also assume that the excitation is uniform across the entire cloud. In this case, we can write the local equation of radiative transfer at a point $r$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_\\nu = \\displaystyle I_\\nu(0)e^{-\\tau_\\nu} + B_\\nu(T_{ex})(1-e^{-\\tau_\\nu})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where as we recall, $B_\\nu$ is the source function $j_\\nu / \\kappa_\\nu$, and per our assumptions above is the same at any point in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the level populations and so the overall excitation state of the gas, we return to our formula for the rate of change of the population of a given energy level $E_u$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\frac{dn_u}{dt} = n_l ( B_{lu} u_\\nu +k_{lu} n_c) - n_u (A_{ul}+B_{ul}u_\\nu+k_{ul} n_c)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the $k$'s are the collisional rate coefficients, $u_\\nu$ is the energy density of the radiation field, and $n_c$ is the number density of the collision partner (typically H$_2$ for molecular gas). Draine rewrites this in terms of the photon occupation number $n_\\gamma$, removing both the dependence on the Einstein B and on $u_\\nu$ and adding a dependence on the level degeneracy $g$ to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\frac{dn_u}{dt} = n_l \\left(n_c k_{lu}  + n_\\gamma \\frac{g_u}{g_l} A_{ul}\\right)  - n_u (n_c k_{ul} + A_{ul}+n_\\gamma A_{ul})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We now apply the definition of $n_\\gamma$, noting that $e^{-\\tau_\\nu}$ is just the escape probability $\\beta_\\nu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$n_\\gamma(\\nu) = \\displaystyle \\langle \\beta \\rangle n_\\gamma^{(0)} + \\frac{1-\\langle\\beta\\rangle}{(n_l g_u / n_u g_l) -1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$n_\\gamma^{(0)} \\equiv \\displaystyle \\frac{c^2}{2 h \\nu^3} I_\\nu(0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of these pieces back together and collecting terms we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\frac{dn_u}{dt} = n_c k_{lu} n_l  - n_c k_{ul}n_u  - \\langle\\beta\\rangle A_{ul} n_u +  n_l\\frac{g_u}{g_l}\\langle\\beta\\rangle A_{ul}n_\\gamma^{(0)} \\left( 1- \\frac{n_u g_l}{n_l g_u}\\right)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "And this monster is the escape probability approximation. In order, these terms correspond to (1) collisional excitation (2) collisional de-excitation (3) spontaneous emission and (4) absorption and stimulated emission. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we have an expression for $\\beta$, we can use this equation to solve for the level populations that result from a full consideration of all collisional processes *and* all radiative processes (absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission) that occur due to photons from the background radiation field and photons that originate within the cloud itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now also write a more accurate expression for the critical density of a transition (the density required for thermalization) that considers radiative trapping: \n",
    "\n",
    "$n_{crit,u} = \\displaystyle \\sum_c \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{l<u}\\langle\\beta_{ul}\\rangle A_{ul}}{\\sum_{l<u}k_{ul}(c)} \\right)$\n",

    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the determination of a $\\beta$ is an iterative problem: guess a $\\beta$, solve for the level populations, use these to calculate $\\tau$ and a new value of $\\beta$, repeat until a consistent result is arrived at. \n",

A more realistic assumption is that the particles are actually moving, either with some uniform bulk motion, or randomly due to turbulence.
