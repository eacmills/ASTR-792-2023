In essence, this is a probability (per time) that, given a photon of the correct energy, it will result in an ionization. Because we are considering the probability that this will occur somewhere in the entire HII region, we can safely set this probability to just be 1. (Note that as this is still technically a probability PER TIME, we will want to keep track of those units). This leaves us with:\n",

The derivation of this fraction is a bit tedius, but is given in **Draine 15.3** (and if you really need a precise determination of HII region structure you will also want to consider the effects of dust, which both will absorb some of the ionizing photons and then as a result will contribute an additional source of pressure beyond that present from the thermal pressure of the gas and radiation pressure on the gas). A complete treatment of the effects of dust is given in **Draine 15.4**.\n",

    "\n",
    "When one discusses rates of processes, or the amount of change in a quantity as a function of time, one inevitably also wants to define timescales on which these quantities undergo some meaningful change. In this case, it could be the time it takes to go from neutral gas to fully ionized gas when a star first \"switches on\", or the time that it takes for gas to become neutral again if a star is moving through the ISM and the gas is no longer within its Stromgren radius. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, it is generally more useful to parametrize this in terms of the rate of emission of ionizing photons $Q_0$. Here the time scale is defined by total number of neutral atoms which must be ionized divided by this photon production rate:\n",

    "Note that for a nebula in ionization equilibrium (which is generally a good assumption for HII regions), these two time scales are identical. This is similar to what we see when we consider objects (like stars) in a dynamical equilibrium: the time scale for contraction (the free-fall time) is the same as the time scale for expansions (the sound-crossing time). Speaking of which...\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to compare the time scales of all the different processes that can affect the structure of a region. While HII regions can typically be assumed to be in ionization equilibrium, it is not generally a good assumption that they are in pressure equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic time scale for changes in the nebula structure due to pressure waves is the sound-crossing time: the time it takes information traveling at the sound speed to cross a distance equal to twice the radius of the nebula:\n",

For now, we will concentrate on what this means for the ionization structure. \n",

    "Different atoms have very different ionization thresholds, so (depending on the hardness of the spectrum of the ionizing source), the radius of the region in which these atoms are fully (multiply) ionized may be smaller than the HII stromgren sphere (or larger in the case of atoms like carbon, which has a lower ionization threshold and so can be ionized by radiation with $h\\nu < 13.6$ eV that escapes the HII region.  \n",

When both H and He are present, some fraction $y$ of the $h\\nu > 24.6$ eV photons which would have been responsible for ionizing hydrogen now go toward ionizing helium.
