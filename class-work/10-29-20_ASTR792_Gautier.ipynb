    "The problem is that once you do get two H$_2$ molecules close enough together to form a covalent bond, there is an excess energy of formation (this is an exothermic reaction) that must be gotten rid of for the molecule to be stable (and not immediately vibrate to bits). And as we talked about last week, H$_2$ is particularly awful at giving off photons: the chance that it will give off a photon in time to avoid coming apart (e.g., during the duration of the collision) is extremely low. How low?\n",

    "There are a few ways to get around this, each with their own challenges. \n",

    "(1) The first way to still make H$_2$ in the gas phase is to require three H atoms to collide, so that the third hydrogen atom can carry away the excess energy from the reaction. This is a three-body interaction, and so requires a very high density to operate efficiently:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. An atom (or molecule) hits a dust grain. This is helped by relatively large dust cross sections (though the number density of dust is fairly low). \n",
    "2. It then has some probability of sticking (the particles sit in small surface potential wells) and remaining on the grain (either due to electrostatic forces, or by forming a chemical bond with the surface). \n",
    "3. Large nuclei tend to stay put in their potential well, and the lighter H atoms hop around, interacting with the particles in other wells. \n",
    "4. Over time, (saturated) molecules then form on the grain surface: H$_2$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CH$_4$, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO etc. \n",
    "5. The dust grain lattice acts as a third body to stabilize formation of molecule, allows it to release excess energy of formation. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Lyman and Werner Bands \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that a pure-rotational transition from $J$=1 to $J$=0 is not allowed for H$_2$. This can make it difficult to probe the populations of these levels (which will contain the bulk of the H$_2$ molecules) as observing emission from these levels requires that levels $J=2$ and higher are populated, which requires relatively high temperatures ($T > 100$ K.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to directly probe the populations of these levels in colder gas via measurements of absorption transitions due to background radiation, where H$_2$ goes from an electronic ground state to an electronically-excited state. These transitions have permitted dipole transitions (so much larger oscillator strengths, meaning they will lead to strong absorption features). Transitions from the electronic ground state to the first electronically-excited state are known as Lyman Band transitions, and transitions from the ground electronic ground state to the second electronically-excited state are known as Werner Band transitions. Looking at cold gas along a line of sight to a strong background radiation source (for example, a quasar or a white dwarf) can then be a good way to directly measure H$_2$ column densities in relatively diffuse gas, and to infer things like the required formation rate of H$_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Photodissociation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, as these are electronic transitions (and so highly energetic), these absorption lines occur at UV wavelengths. \n",
    "Additionally, because the required photons are so energetic, there is about a 10% chance that absorption through the Lyman or Werner bands will result in the dissociation of H$_2$. Here, instead of decaying back to a low rovibrational state in the electronic round state, it decays into a highly vibrationally-excited bound level of the electronic ground state and then emits a photon at a wavelength between 1200 and 1600 angstroms (the H$_2$ \"vibrational continuum\") as the molecular bond breaks and H$_2$ dissociates. This process, known as photodissociation, occurs in only 10$^{-14}$ s! This is the primary mechanism for the destruction of H$_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## UV Pumping\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining 90% of cases, the H$_2$ molecule will eventually de-excite by emitting a cascade of radiation as it returns to the electronic ground state, likely ending up in a rotationally-excited state of H$_2$. The phenomenon in which the absorption of UV radiation leads to an enhanced population in the high-$J$ rotational states of H$_2$ is known as pumping. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that H$_2$ formation into an excited electronic state is actually another potential way to form H$_2$ in the gas phase, as there are dipole-allowed transitions out of the excited electronic state that are much faster than the rovibrational transitions)\n"

    "The presence of strong self-shielding can affect the extent to which UV pumping will influence H$_2$ level populations: for high column densities, the level populations will be primarily affected by collisions, and so can be used to measure the kinetic temperature of the gas. In general, when attempting to use H$_2$ rotational lines as a thermometer, the relative populations of the vibrationally-excited levels, the strength of the background radiation field, and the total gas column density must all be closely scrutinized in order to determine whether the rotational level populations are consistent with collisional excitation or whether the population of high-$J$ levels are primarily influenced by this cascade down from the electronically-excited states. \n",

    "\n",
    "H$_2$ fails 2 out of the 3 criterion here, yet H$_2$ collisional cooling is still important in warm ($T>100$ K) molecular gas simply due to the sheer number of H$_2$ molecules that are present in the ISM, which overwhelms the low probability of an individual molecule emitting a photon after excitation (via a quadrupole rather than dipole interaction).  \n",
    "\n",
    "H$_2$ was also an extremely important species for cooling gas in the very early universe, when making the first stars. At that time, there was no carbon, oxygen, or other metals, and no dust, so the only cooling available is from continuum emission, H recombination lines, and H2. Of course, even forming the H$_2$ necessary to cool the gas was difficult then, as dust-mediated formation is out of the question, so one must rely on a slower gas-phase formation route. "
