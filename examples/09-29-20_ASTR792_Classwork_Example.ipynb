    "(1) The ionization time scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the ionization time scale is $\\displaystyle \\tau_i = \\frac{(4/3)\\pi R_S^3 n_H}{Q_0}$ which means we need to calculate $R_S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$R_S = \\left( \\frac{3 Q_0}{4 \\pi n_H^2 \\alpha_B}\\right)^{1/3}$ so before that we need to calculate $\\alpha_B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_B = \\displaystyle 2.54 \\times10^{-13} Z^2 \\left(\\frac{T_4}{Z^2}\\right)^{-0.8163 -0.0208 \\ln (T_4/Z^2)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "we know $Z=1$ and $T_4=1$ so $\\alpha_B = \\displaystyle 2.54 \\times10^{-13} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then \n",
    "\n",
    "$R_S = \\left( \\frac{(3)10^{48.06}}{4 \\pi (10^4)^2 (2.54 \\times10^{-13})}\\right)^{1/3}$ = 1.5e17 cm or  0.05 pc\n",
    "\n",
    "Why so small? The ionizing flux Q is relatively small (this is probably an O9 star) and the electron density is relatively high (making this a compact or ultracompact HII region). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ionization time scale is then\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\tau_i = \\frac{(4/3)\\pi (1.5\\times10^{17})^3 (10^4)}{10^{48.06}} = 3.9$  years\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The recombination time scale (assuming Case B recombination)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\tau_r = \\frac{1}{10^4 (2.54 \\times10^{-13}) } = 12.5$ years, which is comparable to but slightly longer than the ionization time scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The sound-crossing time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\tau_{sc} = \\frac{2 R_S}{\\left( \\frac{2kT}{m_H}\\right)^{1/2}} = \\frac{2(1.5\\times10^{15} \\mathrm{m})}{\\left( \\frac{2(1.38\\times10^{-23})(10^4)}{1.67\\times10^{-27}}\\right)^{1/2}} = 7400 $ years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is long compared to the ionization/recombination time scales, but rather short compared even to the typical lifetimes of ultracompact HII regions, which are $\\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ years. This means that during this stage of HII region evolution, the HII region may be in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings. \n",
